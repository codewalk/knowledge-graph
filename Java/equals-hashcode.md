The contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods is important to understand when working with hash-based collections such as `HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc. This contract ensures the proper functioning of these collections. Let's explore the contract and its implications:

### Equals and HashCode Contract:

1. **Equals Method:**
   - The `equals()` method is used to compare the contents of objects for equality.
   - It should be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and consistent.

   ```java
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
       // Implementation for equality comparison
   }
   ```

2. **HashCode Method:**
   - The `hashCode()` method returns an integer value, representing the hash code of the object.
   - Equal objects must have the same hash code, but objects with the same hash code are not necessarily equal.
   - It's used in hash-based collections to quickly locate a bucket and then narrow down the search.

   ```java
   public int hashCode() {
       // Implementation for generating hash code
   }
   ```

### Equals and HashCode Contract Rules:

1. **Consistency:**
   - If two objects are equal according to `equals()`, their hash codes must be the same during the lifetime of the objects.

2. **Reflexivity:**
   - An object must be equal to itself.
   - `x.equals(x)` should always return `true`.

3. **Symmetry:**
   - If `x.equals(y)` returns `true`, then `y.equals(x)` should also return `true`.
   - If two objects are equal, their hash codes must be the same.

4. **Transitivity:**
   - If `x.equals(y)` and `y.equals(z)` both return `true`, then `x.equals(z)` should also return `true`.
   - If two objects are equal, their hash codes must be the same.

5. **Consistency of Hash Code:**
   - If `x.equals(y)` returns `true`, then `x.hashCode()` and `y.hashCode()` should return the same value.
   - It's not required for unequal objects to have different hash codes (hash code collision), but it's generally desirable for performance.

### Implications:

1. **Hash-Based Collections:**
   - Ensures proper functioning of hash-based collections (`HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.).
   - Allows objects to be efficiently distributed across buckets.

2. **Equality in Collections:**
   - Enables proper behavior when objects are used as keys in collections.
   - Facilitates accurate retrieval of values from collections.

3. **Consistent Behavior:**
   - Objects that are equal should consistently return the same hash code.
   - Helps maintain the integrity of collections over time.

### Example Implementation:

Here's an example of a proper implementation of `equals()` and `hashCode()` for a class:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructors, getters, setters...

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        MyClass other = (MyClass) obj;
        return age == other.age && Objects.equals(name, other.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }
}
```

This example follows the equals and hashCode contract, ensuring consistent and correct behavior when used in hash-based collections.
