### CyclicBarrier:

**Definition:**
- A `CyclicBarrier` is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other at a common barrier point. It is cyclic because it can be reused after the waiting threads are released.

**Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class CyclicBarrierExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a CyclicBarrier for 3 threads
        CyclicBarrier cyclicBarrier = new CyclicBarrier(3);

        // Creating and starting each thread
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task(cyclicBarrier), "Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task(cyclicBarrier), "Thread 2");
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(new Task(cyclicBarrier), "Thread 3");

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private final CyclicBarrier cyclicBarrier;

        Task(CyclicBarrier cyclicBarrier) {
            this.cyclicBarrier = cyclicBarrier;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting at the barrier.");
                // Thread awaits at the barrier
                cyclicBarrier.await();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has crossed the barrier.");
            } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Business Problem:**
- **Scenario: Parallel Data Processing**
  - **Problem:** Multiple threads are processing different segments of a large dataset concurrently, but you want them to synchronize at the end to combine the processed results.
  - **Solution:** Use a `CyclicBarrier` to make the threads wait for each other at the end of their processing.

### CountDownLatch:

**Definition:**
- A `CountDownLatch` is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

**Example:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class CountDownLatchExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Creating a CountDownLatch with a count of 3
        CountDownLatch countDownLatch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        // Creating and starting three threads
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Task(countDownLatch), "Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Task(countDownLatch), "Thread 2");
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(new Task(countDownLatch), "Thread 3");

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();

        // Main thread waits until count becomes zero
        countDownLatch.await();

        System.out.println("All threads have completed their tasks. Main thread continues.");
    }

    static class Task implements Runnable {
        private final CountDownLatch countDownLatch;

        Task(CountDownLatch countDownLatch) {
            this.countDownLatch = countDownLatch;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            // Simulating some task execution
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has completed its task.");
            // Counting down the latch
            countDownLatch.countDown();
        }
    }
}
```

**Business Problem:**
- **Scenario: Distributed System Initialization**
  - **Problem:** In a distributed system, multiple components or nodes need to be initialized before the system can start serving requests.
  - **Solution:** Use a `CountDownLatch` to make the main initialization thread wait until all components have completed their initialization.

In summary, both `CyclicBarrier` and `CountDownLatch` are synchronization mechanisms that can be used to solve coordination problems in multi-threaded scenarios, where threads need to wait for each other to reach a certain point.
