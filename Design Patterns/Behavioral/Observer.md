The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, that are notified of any changes in the subject's state. This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event handling systems, where one object (the subject) changes its state, and all registered observers are notified and updated automatically.

1. **Observer Interface:**
   The `Observer` interface is implemented by the objects that want to be notified of changes in the subject. This interface usually consists of a method (or methods) that is called by the subject to inform the observer about the state change.

   ```java
   public interface Observer {
       void update(); // or with parameters to pass updated information
   }
   ```

   You can customize the `update` method based on the information you want to pass to the observers.

2. **Subject Interface:**
   The `Subject` interface is implemented by the object that is being observed. It contains methods to manage observers, such as adding and removing observers, and notifying them of any state changes.

   ```java
   public interface Subject {
       void registerObserver(Observer observer);
       void unregisterObserver(Observer observer);
       void notifyObservers();
   }
   ```

   - `registerObserver`: Adds an observer to the list of observers.
   - `unregisterObserver`: Removes an observer from the list of observers.
   - `notifyObservers`: Notifies all registered observers about the state change.

3. **ConcreteSubject:**
   - This is the concrete implementation of the subject. It keeps track of its observers and notifies them when its state changes.

4. **ConcreteObserver:**
   - This is the concrete implementation of the observer. It registers with a subject to receive updates and implements the update method to respond to changes in the subject's state.

Here's a simple example in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Observer interface
interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

// Subject interface
interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer observer);
    void unregisterObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

// Concrete Observer
class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private String observerState;

    @Override
    public void update(String message) {
        this.observerState = message;
        System.out.println("Observer received update: " + observerState);
    }
}

// Concrete Subject
class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String subjectState;

    @Override
    public void registerObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void unregisterObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(subjectState);
        }
    }

    // Method to change the state of the subject and notify observers
    public void setState(String newState) {
        this.subjectState = newState;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}

public class ObserverPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcreteSubject subject = new ConcreteSubject();
        ConcreteObserver observer1 = new ConcreteObserver();
        ConcreteObserver observer2 = new ConcreteObserver();

        subject.registerObserver(observer1);
        subject.registerObserver(observer2);

        subject.setState("New state for the subject");
    }
}
```

In this example, `ConcreteSubject` is the subject, and `ConcreteObserver` is the observer. The subject maintains a list of observers, and when its state changes, it notifies all registered observers.
