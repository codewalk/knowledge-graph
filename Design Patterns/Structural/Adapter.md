The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern involves a single class called the Adapter, which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

The main components of the Adapter pattern are:

1. **Target:**
   - This is the interface that the client code expects. It defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses.

2. **Adaptee:**
   - This is the interface that needs to be adapted. It represents the existing functionality that is incompatible with the client's expectations.

3. **Adapter:**
   - This is the class that implements the Target interface and wraps an instance of the Adaptee. It acts as a bridge between the Target and the Adaptee, translating requests from the Target interface into calls to the Adaptee interface.

The Adapter pattern is particularly useful when integrating new features or systems into an existing codebase without modifying the existing code. It promotes reusability and flexibility by allowing the integration of classes with different interfaces.

Here's a summary of how the Adapter pattern works:

- The client interacts with the Target interface.
- The Adapter class, which implements the Target interface, internally uses an instance of the Adaptee class.
- The Adapter translates the requests from the Target interface to calls to the Adaptee interface.

Example use cases for the Adapter pattern include:

- Integrating new versions of a library or component with changes in their interfaces.
- Making existing classes work with third-party libraries with different interfaces.
- Reusing existing classes in a new system that expects a different interface.

In summary, the Adapter pattern helps in achieving interoperability between classes with incompatible interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

The Adapter pattern involves two main interfaces: the `Target` interface and the `Adaptee` interface. Additionally, there is the `Adapter` class that implements the `Target` interface while wrapping an instance of the `Adaptee` interface.

Here are the core interfaces for the Adapter pattern in Java:

1. **Target Interface:**
   The `Target` interface defines the operations that the client code expects. The `Adapter` class will implement this interface to make the `Adaptee` interface compatible with the client.

   ```java
   public interface Target {
       void request();
   }
   ```

   This is the interface that the client code uses to interact with the target functionality.

2. **Adaptee Interface:**
   The `Adaptee` interface represents the existing functionality that needs to be adapted. It defines the operations that are not compatible with the `Target` interface.

   ```java
   public interface Adaptee {
       void specificRequest();
   }
   ```

   The `specificRequest` method represents the functionality of the existing system.

3. **Adapter Class:**
   The `Adapter` class implements the `Target` interface and wraps an instance of the `Adaptee` interface. It translates the requests from the `Target` interface to calls to the `Adaptee` interface.

   ```java
   public class Adapter implements Target {
       private Adaptee adaptee;

       public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
           this.adaptee = adaptee;
       }

       @Override
       public void request() {
           adaptee.specificRequest();
       }
   }
   ```

   The `Adapter` class delegates the `request` method to the `specificRequest` method of the `Adaptee`.

Here's a simple example in Java:

```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee interface
interface Adaptee {
    void specificRequest();
}

// Adapter class
class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}

// Concrete implementation of Adaptee
class ConcreteAdaptee implements Adaptee {
    @Override
    public void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Specific request in Adaptee");
    }
}

public class AdapterPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the Adapter pattern to make Adaptee compatible with Target
        Adaptee adaptee = new ConcreteAdaptee();
        Target adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);

        // Client code interacts with Target
        adapter.request();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Adapter` class makes the `ConcreteAdaptee` compatible with the `Target` interface. The client code interacts with the `Target` interface without being aware of the underlying `Adaptee` implementation.
